The second problem is just to help you to improve your polish notation
that we learn on the other step the exercise is:

> (= (- 10 (* 2 3)) __)

Let's do this in parts first we solve `(* 2 3)`{{execute}} this is 
equal to 2 * 3 that is 6 

so after that we got:
> (= (- 10 (6)) __)
 
the second part is solve:
> (- 10 (6))

this equation is identical to 10 - 6  that is 4 so:
> (= (4) __)

now is quite simple we just need to type anything that is 
equal to 4 could be any of this solutions

> (4)

> (- 10 6)

> (- 10 (* 2 3))
