If you already done the first step I made you already have all ready for run the command bellow on your terminal and start lein.

To run Clojure you can just type `lein repl`{{execute}} on a Terminal.

The first problem show you the boolean on clojure are in this [link](https://www.4clojure.com/problem/1)

there are a few answers for (= __ true) some of them are

(= true true)
 
 or
 
(= (not false) true)

or 

(= (= 3 3) true)


any of these answers should give you the correct answer

###HOW CLOJURE PROCESS THIS 
first clojure will solve the operand '=' after this he will look for 
the next to parameters (true) | (not false) | (= 3 3) and will
check if this is equals to the second (true)
